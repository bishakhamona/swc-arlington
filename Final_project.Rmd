This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Compare GDP growth across years in India, China and Niger

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library("dplyr")

gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", 
                     sep = "\t", 
                     header = TRUE)
india.gdp <- gap.in %>% filter(country == "India") 
plot(india.gdp$year, india.gdp$gdpPercap, type = "p", main = "GDP growth in India", xlab = "Year", ylab = "GDP")

china.gdp <- gap.in %>% filter(country == "China") 
plot(china.gdp$year, china.gdp$gdpPercap, type = "p", main = "GDP growth in China", xlab = "Year", ylab = "GDP")

niger.gdp <- gap.in %>% filter(country == "Niger") 
plot(niger.gdp$year, niger.gdp$gdpPercap, type = "p", main = "GDP growth in Niger", xlab = "Year", ylab = "GDP")

lifeExp.sum <- gap.in %>%
  select(continent, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(min = min(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp), max = max(lifeExp)) 

lifeExp.sum


```

The mean life expectancy for each continent is summarized above.

The global life expectency has been summarized below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

hist(gap.in$lifeExp, main = "Global life expectancy", xlab = "Life expectancy")
```

Life expectancy with narrow bid width gives a detailed look at frequency at each age group.

```{r, echo =FALSE}
hist(gap.in$lifeExp, main = "Global life expectancy", xlab = "Life expectancy", breaks = 200)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
